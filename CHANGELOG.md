# Changelog

All notable changes to Tandem will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Link (Ctrl+K), Horizontal Rule, and Code Block buttons in the formatting toolbar (#204)
- Suggestion cards show a visual diff — original text in red strikethrough → replacement in green (#195)
- Undo countdown progress bar — a shrinking indicator shows the 10-second undo window (#196)
- Review mode shortcut hints (Y / N / ↑↓ / Z) shown below the Review button (#200)
- Chat anchor previews expand on hover to show full text (#198)
- `disabledTitle` prop on toolbar buttons — annotation buttons show "Select text first" when no text is selected (#197)
- Explicit ✕ close button on the highlight color picker (#203)

### Fixed

- Toolbar wraps to a second row on narrow windows instead of overflowing; inline inputs shrink responsively (#192)
- Edit button on annotation cards now shows a visible "✎ Edit" label instead of icon-only (#201)

## [0.2.12] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Undo/redo toolbar buttons powered by Y.js UndoManager — tracks document edits with proper CRDT-aware undo scoping (#189, #210)
- Adjustable editor content width toggle — switch between comfortable and full-width layouts, preference persists in localStorage (#185, #205)
- SVG icons for unordered list, ordered list, and blockquote toolbar buttons, replacing plain text labels (#194)
- Automated npm publishing via GitHub Actions with OIDC trusted publisher (tokenless)

### Fixed

- Guard all localStorage access with try-catch for private/disabled browser storage modes; reset scroll position on annotation filter clear (#212, #202)

## [0.2.11] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Auto-reload documents when files change on disk — Tandem detects external edits (e.g., Claude's Edit tool) via `fs.watch`, reloads content, and preserves existing annotations (#175)
- File watcher module with 500ms debounce and self-write suppression (prevents reload loops when Tandem saves)
- Toast notification when a document is reloaded from disk
- Runtime warning when `onDocSwapped` callback is missing during Hocuspocus doc swap (defensive guard for #178 audit)
- 28 new tests: observer reattachment, CTRL_ROOM lifecycle, buffer cap, file watcher debounce/suppress, annotation-preserving reload

### Fixed

- Dead CRDT `relRange` handling — `refreshRange` now strips broken CRDT anchors and re-anchors from flat offsets instead of leaving annotations permanently stuck with non-functional RelativePositions (#175)
- Buffer cap test was previously a no-op (empty loop body) — now actually exercises the event queue buffer (#178)

### Changed

- CLAUDE.md gotcha for Hocuspocus doc replacement updated to document the automatic `onDocSwapped` callback lifecycle (#178)

## [0.2.10] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Resizable side panel — drag to resize between 200–600px, width persists in localStorage
- Accessibility: ARIA labels on annotation highlights (type-specific), annotation cards (`role="listitem"`, `aria-current`), annotation list (`role="list"`), review mode button (`aria-pressed`), live region for pending count and review progress

### Fixed

- Flaky session tests — each test file now uses an isolated temp directory via `vi.mock`, eliminating cross-file race conditions (#177)
- Session file writes use atomic rename with retry on Windows EPERM/EACCES (#173)

### Changed

- `atomicWrite()` extracted as shared helper in session manager — consolidates duplicate write-tmp-rename logic with exponential backoff retry

## [0.2.9] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Changelog tab no longer disappears after upgrade — version check and sample/welcome.md now open before servers start, preventing CRDT merge races with stale browser tabs
- Tutorial annotation injection errors now get their own log message instead of being misattributed as file-open failures

## [0.2.8] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- CHANGELOG.md opens as the active tab on first startup after an npm update
- `checkVersionChange` helper tracks version transitions via `last-seen-version` file
- CHANGELOG.md now ships in the npm package

## [0.2.7] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Force-reload (`tandem_open` with `force: true`) now clears Y.Doc in-place instead of destroying the Hocuspocus room — sidebar, observers, and connections survive
- TOCTOU fix: session deletion moved after successful reload transaction
- Observer ownership table corrected in architecture docs

### Added

- 4 new tests for force-reload (annotation clearing, awareness clearing, .txt reload, metadata)

## [0.2.6] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Demo script rewritten to be self-referential for recording
- Observer ownership documentation added to architecture.md

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- `tandem setup` Claude Code MCP config path updated

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- `tandem setup` now writes Claude Code MCP config to `~/.claude.json` instead of `~/.claude/mcp_settings.json`, which Claude Code no longer reads

## [0.2.2] - 2025-04-05

### Fixed

- Silent failure review findings

## [0.2.1] - 2025-04-05

### Fixed
